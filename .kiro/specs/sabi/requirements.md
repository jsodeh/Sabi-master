# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Sabi is an adaptive learning companion that controls and orchestrates the user's entire learning environment. It combines browser automation, real-time guidance, and multimodal AI capabilities to provide personalized, hands-on learning experiences. The system can autonomously navigate web-based tools, explain actions in real-time, and guide users from initial concepts to production-ready implementations without requiring them to write code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to request learning experiences through natural language prompts, so that I can learn complex topics without needing to know where to start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a natural language learning request THEN the system SHALL parse the intent and create a structured learning plan
2. WHEN the system receives a request like "Teach me how to build a fashion website without writing code" THEN it SHALL identify relevant tools and create a step-by-step learning path
3. WHEN processing user requests THEN the system SHALL support multimodal input including text, voice, and images
4. IF a user request is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to autonomously control my browser and navigate to appropriate learning tools, so that I don't have to manually search for and set up learning environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learning session begins THEN the system SHALL automatically open browsers and navigate to relevant web-based tools
2. WHEN navigating to tools like builder.io, firebase studio, lovable, bolt.new, or replit THEN the system SHALL handle authentication and initial setup
3. WHEN interacting with web interfaces THEN the system SHALL perform actions like clicking, typing, highlighting, and form filling
4. WHEN encountering errors or unexpected UI changes THEN the system SHALL adapt and find alternative paths to complete objectives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner, I want real-time explanations of every action the system takes, so that I understand the reasoning behind each step and can learn from the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs any action THEN it SHALL provide a clear explanation of what it's doing and why
2. WHEN clicking on interface elements THEN the system SHALL explain the purpose and expected outcome of that action
3. WHEN navigating between tools or pages THEN the system SHALL explain the workflow and how each step contributes to the overall goal
4. WHEN making decisions between multiple options THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning for its choice

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner, I want interactive guidance elements like cue cards, tooltips, and modals, so that I can receive contextual help and reinforcement during the learning process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is explaining concepts THEN it SHALL display relevant cue cards with key information
2. WHEN hovering over or interacting with interface elements THEN the system SHALL show contextual tooltips
3. WHEN reaching important learning milestones THEN the system SHALL present interactive modals with summaries and next steps
4. WHEN the user needs additional clarification THEN the system SHALL provide expandable help sections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer/administrator, I want to add and manage documentation with URLs and learning resources, so that the system can access up-to-date information about tools and processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new learning resources THEN the system SHALL support documentation with URLs, descriptions, and metadata
2. WHEN managing tool documentation THEN the system SHALL allow categorization by skill level, topic, and tool type
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL automatically incorporate new information into learning paths
4. WHEN tools change their interfaces THEN the system SHALL allow documentation updates to maintain accuracy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to guide me through the complete journey from initial concept to production deployment, so that I can see real-world results of my learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a project THEN the system SHALL create a complete roadmap from concept to deployment
2. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL guide through design, development, testing, and deployment phases
3. WHEN reaching deployment stage THEN the system SHALL handle hosting setup and production configuration
4. WHEN the project is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of what was learned and suggest next steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to adapt its teaching style based on my progress and preferences, so that I receive personalized instruction that matches my learning pace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user demonstrates understanding THEN the system SHALL adjust the pace and reduce explanation detail
2. WHEN a user struggles with concepts THEN the system SHALL provide additional examples and slower progression
3. WHEN tracking user progress THEN the system SHALL maintain learning profiles and preferences
4. WHEN resuming sessions THEN the system SHALL continue from where the user left off with appropriate context

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully, so that my learning experience isn't interrupted by technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web tools are unavailable THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative tools or approaches
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL guide the user through re-authentication
3. WHEN UI elements change unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL adapt its interaction patterns
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL explain what happened and how to recover

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to interact with the system through multiple input methods, so that I can learn in the way that's most comfortable for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing input THEN the system SHALL accept text, voice, and image inputs
2. WHEN using voice input THEN the system SHALL provide accurate speech recognition and natural responses
3. WHEN sharing images THEN the system SHALL analyze visual content and incorporate it into learning context
4. WHEN switching between input methods THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context seamlessly

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to provide progress tracking and learning analytics, so that I can see my improvement over time and identify areas for further development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing learning activities THEN the system SHALL track progress and time spent
2. WHEN finishing projects THEN the system SHALL assess skill development and knowledge gained
3. WHEN viewing progress THEN the system SHALL provide visual dashboards and learning analytics
4. WHEN identifying knowledge gaps THEN the system SHALL suggest targeted learning activities
